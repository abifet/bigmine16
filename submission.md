Proceedings will be published as a dedicated volume of the [*JMLR: Workshop and Conference Proceedings*](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/) (this is not equivalent to a regular issue of JMLR).

The maximum length of papers in this format is **16 pages** for regular papers, and **4 pages** for short papers. 

Submitted papers should be formatted according to the KDD format or JMLR format for reviewing. Camera-ready papers should be formatted only with the JMLR format. Papers that do not meet the formatting requirements will be rejected.

Only the LaTex preparation system is supported for publication in the JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings series.

For accepted papers, authors will have the opportunity to revise their papers in response to the reviewers before final submission for publication in the proceedings.
